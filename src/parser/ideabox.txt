- i need to brainstorm the whole idea.
ui:
- load file option
- show file as in spreadsheets, show total number of rows
- pre-processor: join children.
    - analyze and show records which have multiple, show total number
    - option to join children by creating extra row
    - re-order with new rows
    - show completion and new row count
- pre-processor: pick only records from specific dates
    - show range of dates
    - let enter the new range
    - show how many in that range
    - provide action to enable the filter, show enabled filter in general section (together with row count)
- give list of columns to chose and change order. like two columns, pick from one, put into another, move up/down
- save file save dialog and option to name new or overwrite something else

intent. the app loads raw xl file.
as outcome it offloads another refined xl with only columns selected by the user.
as interim processing, as pre-processor option, combine child records by creating new row.
